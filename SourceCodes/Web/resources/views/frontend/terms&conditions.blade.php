                            from the SITE, you expressly agree to abide and be bound by these Terms and Conditions,
                            (“Terms”), as well as all applicable laws, ordinances, regulations, and any agreements
                            incorporated herein by reference (e.g., our Privacy Policy). SITE reserves the right to

                            amendments, or alterations, regardless of kind, shall become effective and binding upon you
                            once posted by us to the SITE. The “Last Updated” date above will tell you when the terms

                            which you previously agreed to, this version governs. If USER violates these TERMS SITE may
                            terminate USER'S access to the SITE, bar USER from future use of the SITE, cancel USER'S
                            ticket order, and/or take appropriate legal action against USER.</p>

                        <p class="policies_para pb-1"> EncoreEvents.live ('SITE') acts as a marketplace,
                            an intermediary between buyers and ticket sellers ('TICKET SELLERS') to facilitate the
                            purchase and sale of event tickets, and as such is not directly involved in the actual
                            ticket sale transaction between the buyers and TICKET SELLERS. <b>All sales are final.</b>
                            As tickets sold through SITE are often obtained through the secondary market and prices are
                            determined by the individual ticket seller, the prices for tickets may be above or below
                            face value (i.e., the cost listed on the ‘face’ of the ticket itself). Tickets sold through
                            SITE are from a third party; therefore, sometimes the buyer's name will not be printed on
                            the tickets. Please note that the name on the tickets does not affect the buyer's ability to
                            access the event.</p>
                        <p class="policies_para pb-1">
                            If an event is cancelled, you will be given a full refund minus any delivery charges if
                                the tickets have already been delivered.</li>
                        </p>
                        <p class="policies_para pb-1"> <b>All sales are final</b> Since tickets are a one-of-a-kind item
                            and not replaceable, there are no refunds, exchanges or cancellations. If an event is
                            postponed or rescheduled, tickets will be honored for the rescheduled date. New
                            tickets generally will not need to be issued; in the rare case that new tickets are needed,
                            USER will be contacted by the TICKET SELLER.
                        </p>

                        <p class="policies_para pb-1"> If an event is cancelled without a rescheduled date, USER
                            will need to contact the TICKET SELLER who fulfills USER's order (hereinafter, “FULFILLER”)
                            for a refund. The FULFILLER may require USER to return the supplied tickets at USER's
                            expense before receiving any refund USER is entitled to due to cancellation. SITE is not
                            responsible for providing or securing this refund for USER. Any shipping and handling
                            charges are not refundable. Refunds will be processed in the same currency as the original
                            order. Conversion charges, including though not exhaustive of the ones issued by USER's
                            bank, if any, are not covered by SITE or Fulfiller. Neither SITE nor the FULFILLER will
                            issue exchanges or refunds after a purchase has been made or for lost, stolen, damaged or
                            destroyed tickets. When USER receives tickets, USER should keep them in a safe place. Please
                            note that direct sunlight or heat may damage tickets. </p>

                        <p class="policies_para pb-1"> Above Face Value tickets obtained through SITE are often
                            obtained through secondary market TICKET SELLERS and are being resold, in many cases, above
                            the price or 'face value' listed on the ticket. All ticket prices include additional service
                            charges and handling fees as defined on each order. SITE and TICKET SELLERS are not directly
                            affiliated with any performer, sports team, or venue; and SITE does not act as a primary
                            sale box office, unless otherwise stated. By agreeing to these TERMS, USER agrees that the
                            purchase price for tickets on their order does not reflect the original purchase price of
                            the ticket and may be either higher or lower than the original purchase price.</p>

                            listings on SITE are a unique set of tickets from an individual TICKET SELLER. Some listings
                            on SITE may only be representations of available tickets or an offer by SITE to obtain
                            tickets and not actual seat locations or currently available tickets.</p>

                        <p class="policies_para pb-1"> Occasionally tickets ordered may no longer be available at the
                            price or in the quantity originally ordered at the time the order is received. If equivalent
                            or better seat locations are available at the same price, the TICKET SELLER will fill the
                            order with the alternative seat locations. If no alternates are available, either USER'S
                            credit card will not be charged at all or the entire amount will be refunded, and USER will
                            be notified that the USER's request has been rejected.</p>

                        <p class="policies_para pb-1">Orders placed through SITE will be fulfilled by one of
                            SITE'S network of participating TICKET SELLERS. Contact information for the FULFILLER will
                            be provided to USER upon completion of the purchase process. If this information is lost,
                            USER may contact CustomerSupport@EncoreEvents.live to retrieve information about the order.
                            USER should carefully enter all required information when submitting an order. USER is
                            responsible for any errors made when entering their information, errors may result in issues
                            such as a delay in processing the order or in delivery of tickets or in cancellation of
                            order. All orders placed on the SITE or with the customer contact center must be confirmed
                            by the respective seller before the buyer guarantee takes effect. </p>

                            not currently possess. These tickets may be marked on the listing as 'Zone Tickets' or as
                            'tickets not in hand'. If you purchase Zone Tickets or tickets marked as 'not in hand', the
                            seller is committing to obtain the tickets described for you upon receipt of your order.
                            These tickets, like all tickets sold on this SITE, are backed by our 100% Money Back
                            Guarantee. After you place your order and your order is confirmed by the seller, we
                            guarantee that your tickets will be within the area listed or one comparable or better and
                            that you will receive these tickets in time for the event or you will get your money back.

                            USER to inform them of different price with an option to purchase, or cancel USER'S order
